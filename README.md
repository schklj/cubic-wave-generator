# cubic-wave-generator
usb very low frequency square wave generator with low output impedance, fixed at 50% duty cycle

soldering pads are enlarged to make it more optimized for a more *banausic* pcb fabrication techniques
can size 55*44

# ideas for improvement 
* adding n-fet to the output amplification circuit
* feeding the the output amplification from the bjt totem pole instead of timer output
* intoducing h-brige to remove the dc offset in the output signal
* making it based on AD9833 with digital control
